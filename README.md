## 😫 The Problem: Your AI Has a Terrible Memory

Traditional project documentation becomes a bloated mess over time. Your AI coding assistant spends half its context window just trying to remember what happened last week.

**Before Log File Genius:**
- 📊 **90,000-110,000 tokens** of verbose logs.
- 🤖 **45-55% of your AI's context window** wasted on history.
- ❌ **Result:** The AI lacks context, makes uninformed decisions, and repeats past mistakes.

It's like trying to have a conversation with someone who has amnesia. Every. Single. Day.

Or maybe you are new here and vibe coding your first projects. 

**Vibe Coding Before Log File Genius:**
- 📊 **50,000-70,000 tokens** of retrying work-arounds and responding to your questions about how code works.
- 🤖 **45-55% of your AI's context window** wasted on hand holding and ineffective loops through code.
- ❌ **Result:** The AI has the wrong context, makes bad decisions, and hallucinates.

## 💡 The Solution: A Genius-Level Memory

Log File Genius is a five-document system that gives your AI a an improved long-term memory while consuming less than **5%** of its context window.

**After Log File Genius:**
- 📊 **~7,000-10,000 tokens** for complete project history.
- 🤖 **93% reduction** in context bloat. 
- ✅ **Result:** The AI has near-instant access to all decisions, changes, and narratives, leading to smarter, faster, and more accurate coding.

| Document | The Vibe | Purpose | Token Budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PRD** | The Dream ✨ | What we're building and why | ~5k tokens |
| **CHANGELOG** | The Facts 📊 | What changed (files, versions, facts) | ~2k tokens |
| **DEVLOG** | The Story ✍️ | *Why* it changed (the narrative, the reasoning) | ~3k tokens |
| **ADRs** | The Rules 🏛️ | How we made significant decisions | On-demand |
| **STATE** | The Current State | What agent on what task? | <500 tokens |

## 🧠 Why It's Genius

This isn't just another documentation template. It's a complete system designed for AI-first development.

- **93% Token Reduction:** Keep your context window free for what matters: the code you're writing *right now*. Sheds old context like a snake sheds its skin.

- **Near Perfect Project Memory:** The five-document system separates facts from narrative, giving your AI a complete, holistic understanding of the project's history and goals.

- **⚡ Zero-Search Navigation:** With bidirectional frontmatter linking, your AI never wastes tokens searching for files. It instantly knows where to find related documents.

- **🤖 Multi-Agent Ready:** The included `STATE.md` file and handoff protocol provide a lightweight coordination layer, preventing agent collisions and duplicated work in complex, multi-agent environments.

- **Scalable by Design:** The built-in archiving strategy keeps your active logs lean and fast, even on multi-year projects.

- **Tool Agnostic:** Works seamlessly with Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Augment, and any other AI coding assistant. Your toaster will probably be running it soon.

## � Repository Structure


See [`.project-identity.yaml`](.project-identity.yaml) for the full explanation of this structure and why it exists.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-Command Installation (30 Seconds)

**For detailed installation instructions, troubleshooting, and next steps, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).**

Install Log File Genius in your existing project with a single command:

**Bash/Mac/Linux:**
```bash
git submodule add -b main \
  https://github.com/clark-mackey/log-file-genius.git \
  .log-file-genius && \
  ./.log-file-genius/product/scripts/install.sh
```

**PowerShell/Windows:**
```powershell
git submodule add -b main `
  https://github.com/clark-mackey/log-file-genius.git `
  .log-file-genius; `
  .\.log-file-genius\product\scripts\install.ps1
```

The installer will:
- ✅ Detect your AI assistant (Augment, Claude Code, etc.)
- ✅ Prompt for your profile (solo-developer, team, open-source, startup)
- ✅ Create standard `/logs/` folder structure
- ✅ Install log file templates and AI assistant rules
- ✅ Configure everything for immediate use

**What gets installed:**
- `logs/` - All your log files (CHANGELOG, DEVLOG, STATE, ADRs, incidents)
- `.augment/` or `.claude/` - AI assistant rules
- `.logfile-config.yml` - Profile configuration

**What stays hidden:**
- `.log-file-genius/` - Source repository (templates, scripts, docs - for updates)

### ✅ Post-Installation Verification

After installation, your project root should contain **ONLY** these files/folders:

**Visible:**
- `logs/` folder (contains CHANGELOG.md, DEVLOG.md, STATE.md, adr/)
- `.logfile-config.yml` file (your profile configuration)

**Hidden (may not show in file explorer by default):**
- `.log-file-genius/` folder (git submodule - the source repository)
- `.augment/` or `.claude/` folder (AI assistant rules)
- `.git/` folder (your project's git repository)

**❌ If you see a visible `log-file-genius/` folder (without the dot), something went wrong.** This means a full clone was created instead of a submodule. Delete it and re-run the installation command.

**Total visible items added to your project root: 2** (logs/ folder + .logfile-config.yml file)

### Updating Log File Genius

Already installed? Update to the latest version:

```bash
# Update source
cd .log-file-genius && git pull && cd ..

# Re-run installer (smart merge, preserves customizations)
./.log-file-genius/product/scripts/install.sh --force
```

---

### Migration from Existing Docs

Already have documentation? The installer creates a clean `/logs/` structure. You can:
- **Start fresh:** Let the installer create new templates, then manually migrate your existing content
- **Brownfield:** Keep your existing docs where they are and use Log File Genius alongside them
- **Full migration:** Copy your existing CHANGELOG/DEVLOG content into the new `/logs/` files

For detailed migration strategies, see [**Migration Guide**](.log-file-genius/docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).
