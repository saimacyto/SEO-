# Augment Starter Pack

Get up and running with Log File Genius in Augment in under 2 minutes.

## 🚀 Quick Setup (Automated - Recommended)

**One command installs everything:**

```bash
# Bash/Mac/Linux
git submodule add -b main \
  https://github.com/clark-mackey/log-file-genius.git \
  .log-file-genius && \
  ./.log-file-genius/product/scripts/install.sh

# PowerShell/Windows
git submodule add -b main `
  https://github.com/clark-mackey/log-file-genius.git `
  .log-file-genius; `
  .\.log-file-genius\product\scripts\install.ps1
```

**The installer will:**
1. Detect that you're using Augment (or prompt you to select)
2. Ask which profile fits your project (solo-developer, team, open-source, startup)
3. Ask where your log files should be located (brownfield support)
4. Install all necessary files:
   - `log-file-genius/` - Templates, scripts, and git hooks (ONE folder)
   - `.augment/rules/` - AI assistant rules
   - `.logfile-config.yml` - Profile configuration with your log file paths
5. Configure everything for immediate use

**What stays hidden:**
- `.log-file-genius/` - Source repository (for easy updates)

## 📖 Manual Setup (Advanced)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand manual installation instructions</summary>

If you prefer manual installation or need more control:

1. **Copy the `.augment/` directory from this starter pack to your project root:**
   ```bash
   # From the log-file-genius repository
   cp -r .log-file-genius/product/starter-packs/augment/.augment/ .
   ```

2. **Create log-file-genius folder and copy files:**
   ```bash
   # Create folder
   mkdir -p log-file-genius

   # Copy templates
   cp -r .log-file-genius/product/templates/ log-file-genius/templates/

   # Copy validation scripts
   cp -r .log-file-genius/product/scripts/validate-log-files.* log-file-genius/scripts/

   # Copy git hooks
   cp -r .log-file-genius/product/starter-packs/augment/.git-hooks/ log-file-genius/git-hooks/
   ```

3. **Copy the profile configuration (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   cp .log-file-genius/product/starter-packs/augment/.logfile-config.yml .
   ```

   **Choose your profile:** Edit `.logfile-config.yml` and set your profile:
   - `solo-developer` (default) - Individual developers, flexible
   - `team` - Teams of 2+, consistent documentation
   - `open-source` - Public projects, strict formatting
   - `startup` - MVPs/prototypes, minimal overhead

   **Add log file paths:** Add a `paths` section to `.logfile-config.yml`:
   ```yaml
   paths:
     changelog: docs/planning/CHANGELOG.md
     devlog: docs/planning/DEVLOG.md
     adr: docs/adr
     state: docs/STATE.md
   ```

   See `.log-file-genius/product/docs/profile-selection-guide.md` for help choosing.

4. **Install git hook (optional):**
   ```bash
   cp log-file-genius/git-hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit  # Mac/Linux only
   ```

</details>

## ✅ Next Steps

After installation (automated or manual):

1. **Open your project in Augment:**
   - Augment will automatically detect and load the rules from `.augment/rules/`

2. **Initialize your log files:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs/planning docs/adr
   cp log-file-genius/templates/CHANGELOG_template.md docs/planning/CHANGELOG.md
   cp log-file-genius/templates/DEVLOG_template.md docs/planning/DEVLOG.md
   cp log-file-genius/templates/ADR_template.md docs/adr/ADR-template.md
   ```

3. **Start using the system:**
   - Make a code change
   - Commit it
   - Augment will automatically update your CHANGELOG (if the rule is active)

## What's Included in This Starter Pack

### Augment Configuration
- **`.augment/rules/log-file-maintenance.md`** - Always-active maintenance rules
- **`.augment/rules/status-update.md`** - Status update command
- **`.augment/rules/update-planning-docs.md`** - Documentation update command

### Profile Configuration (Optional but Recommended)
- **`.logfile-config.yml`** - Profile configuration file
  - Choose from 4 predefined profiles (solo-developer, team, open-source, startup)
  - Customize token targets, validation strictness, archival settings
  - See `product/docs/profile-selection-guide.md` for help choosing

### Validation Tools (Optional but Recommended)
- **`product/scripts/validate-log-files.ps1`** - PowerShell validation script (Windows)
- **`product/scripts/validate-log-files.sh`** - Bash validation script (Mac/Linux/WSL)
- **`.git-hooks/pre-commit`** - Git hook template for automatic validation (cross-platform)
- **Profile-aware:** Validation scripts automatically read `.logfile-config.yml` and apply profile settings

### Templates (Copy from main repository)
You'll need to copy the templates from the main `templates/` directory:
- `CHANGELOG_template.md`
- `DEVLOG_template.md`
- `STATE_template.md`
- `ADR_template.md`

## Available Commands

Once set up, you can use these commands with Augment:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **"@status update"** | Provides a 3-5 bullet point summary of project status |
| **"@update planning docs"** | Guides you through updating CHANGELOG, DEVLOG, or PRD |
| **Run validation** | Manually run `.\scripts\validate-log-files.ps1` to check log files |

## Customization

### Adding Custom Rules

1. Create a new file in `.augment/rules/`:
   ```bash
   touch .augment/rules/my-custom-rule.md
   ```

2. Add your rule content following this format:
   ```markdown
   # My Custom Rule
   
   When the user says "trigger phrase", do this:
   
   1. Step 1
   2. Step 2
   3. Step 3
   ```

3. Augment will automatically load the new rule on next session

### Adjusting Token Budgets and Validation

**Recommended:** Use the profile system by editing `.logfile-config.yml`:

```yaml
profile: solo-developer

# Override token targets
overrides:
  token_targets:
    changelog_error: 12000  # Increase from default 10,000
    devlog_error: 20000     # Increase from default 15,000
```

**Alternative:** Edit `.augment/rules/log-file-maintenance.md` to adjust token targets (legacy method):

```markdown
## Token Budget Targets

- **CHANGELOG:** <10,000 tokens (adjust as needed)
- **DEVLOG:** <15,000 tokens (adjust as needed)
- **Combined:** <25,000 tokens (adjust as needed)
```

**Note:** The profile system (`.logfile-config.yml`) is the recommended approach as it integrates with validation scripts and provides more flexibility.

### Making Rules Always-On vs Manual

By default, `log-file-maintenance.md` is always active. To make it manual:

1. Rename the file to indicate manual trigger (e.g., `manual-log-file-maintenance.md`)
2. Update your workflow to explicitly invoke it when needed

## Troubleshooting

### Augment isn't loading the rules
- Make sure `.augment/rules/` directory exists in your project root
- Verify rule files have `.md` extension
- Try restarting Augment or reloading the project
- Check that the files aren't corrupted or empty

### Rules aren't being followed
- Verify the rule files exist in `.augment/rules/`
- Make sure you're using the exact command phrases (e.g., "@status update")
- Check if the rule is set to always-on or manual trigger
- Review the rule content for any syntax errors

### Token budgets are being exceeded
- Run the archival process (see `docs/log_file_how_to.md`)
- Adjust token targets in `log-file-maintenance.md`
- Consider condensing older entries
- Archive entries older than 30 days

### Augment is updating the wrong files
- Verify file paths in the rules match your project structure
- Check that you have the correct directory structure:
  - `project/planning/CHANGELOG.md` (for Log File Genius itself)
  - `project/planning/DEVLOG.md` (for Log File Genius itself)
  - `project/adr/README.md` (for Log File Genius itself)
  - OR `docs/planning/CHANGELOG.md` (for your own projects)
  - OR `docs/planning/DEVLOG.md` (for your own projects)
  - OR `docs/adr/README.md` (for your own projects)
- Update paths in rules if your structure differs

## Advanced Configuration

### Multi-Agent Coordination

If you're using multiple AI agents (Augment + Claude Code, etc.):

1. Enable `STATE.md` for real-time coordination
2. Update `STATE.md` at the start/end of each work session
3. Have each agent check `STATE.md` before starting work
4. Use the handoff protocol in `product/docs/log_file_how_to.md`

### Custom File Paths

If your project uses different paths:

1. Edit each rule file in `.augment/rules/`
2. Update file path references to match your structure
3. Test with a small change to verify paths are correct

Example path customization:
```markdown
# Before (default)
Update `docs/planning/CHANGELOG.md`

# After (custom)
Update `documentation/logs/CHANGELOG.md`
```

## Next Steps

1. **Read the full methodology:** `docs/log_file_how_to.md`
2. **Check out examples:** `examples/` directory
3. **Customize for your workflow:** Adjust rules and token budgets as needed
4. **Join the community:** Share your experience in GitHub Discussions

## Tips for Success

### Best Practices
- **Commit frequently** - Smaller, focused commits make better CHANGELOG entries
- **Update STATE.md regularly** - Especially in multi-agent environments
- **Archive monthly** - Keep token budgets under control
- **Review before archiving** - Make sure important context is preserved

### Common Patterns
- **After each commit:** Let Augment update CHANGELOG automatically
- **After major decisions:** Manually update DEVLOG with context
- **Before switching agents:** Update STATE.md with current status
- **Weekly:** Review token budgets and archive if needed

### Integration with Git Workflow
```bash
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature X"

# Augment automatically updates CHANGELOG

# For significant changes, also update DEVLOG
# Ask Augment: "@update planning docs"

# Push changes
git push
```
